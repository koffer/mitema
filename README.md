## Description
The purpose of this theme is to learn more about how themes development work in OJS. It is based on the [Immersion theme](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-theming-guide/en/theme-immersion). because it is a theme with a very pleasant and practical layout to have easy-to-read content.

This theme attempts to achieve the following goals:

1- Use CSS and stop using any preprocessor. In this case stop using LESS. CSS options have come a long way and it is now possible to do almost everything that is required with CSS alone (work in progress).

2- Stop using Boostrap classes in layout. It is now possible to replicate much of Boostrap's functionality with CSS options such as flex or grid without having to use the classes that Bootstrap uses (it's not ready yet).

3- Make a simple and attractive design based on the arrangement of the Immersion theme.

## Installation
This theme can be installed through the **Plugin Gallery** in Open Journal Systems. If it's not available in the plugin gallery, you may need to update Open Journal Systems to a compatible version.


## Troubleshooting
For technical question regarding the theme (bugs, enhancements, etc.), please open an issue on the plugin's GitHub page. For non-technical questions or if you are uncertain about the question's category please visit the [PKP Forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/). Before opening and issue or posting a question on forum please make sure that it wasn't solved before.

## Settings

**Sections' Background Color |** Immersion theme adds an option for changing background color of issue sections. It is available under issue menu (for each issue). Picked colors will be displayed prominently on the journal landing page and issue page. The default background color for all sections is white and can be set differently for each section.

**Section description |** If Browse By Section plugin is activated and configured, the theme allows to display a description for each section on the index journal and issue page which is added through the section form.
